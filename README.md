# Beziercurve_Interactive
I implemented a simple Tool for Students who wants to inspect Beziercurves.
This Tool have just only one spline with two curvesegments each parameterizable to grade n=27

### 1. you can inspect the flexibility of a curve with higher grades
### 2. continuity of GC0, GC1 and GC2 is also inspectable with limited degrees of freedom for each continuity
### 3. restrictions of continuity will show you the attributes of tracks contructed with beziercurves
